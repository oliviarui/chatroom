The other user does not necessarily have to be in the room for this to happen. 2) Users can send messages with different importance, which will show the message with a different color. 3) Room announcement messages appear in the chatlog whenever a user joins, is kicked out, or is banned. General messages from the server will appear at the top of the screen telling a user when they have been kicked out of a room, if the room they are trying to join does not exist, etc.
